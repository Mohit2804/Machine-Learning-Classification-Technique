# Rebuilding images using CNN and Autoencoders

# INTRODUCTION
In this project, the main objective is to implement image classification problem by rebuilding images using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and Autoencoders. To reduce the streams of the data, in order to provide the data to the users physically we will be using two compression techniques which is Lossy and lossless for Autoencoders. To rebuild the images, we will decompose the image and re-present it in 32-vector code using Autoencoders. We will be using CNN to recognize or detect the face in the images. All methods and algorithms have been executed in the Python programming language using Artificial Neural Network archive. As the dataset has lots of images, we need to reshape the data and data splitting into training and testing, Visualizing it in the graph format and then get the better outcome and the least loss.
